  <h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
  <p>The <em>Indus civilisation</em> also known as Indus Valley civilisation (IVC),[1] was a Bronze Age civilisation in the northwestern regions of South Asia, lasting from 3300 BCE to 1300 BCE, and in its mature form from 2600 BCE to 1900 BCE.[2][a]
    Together with ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was one of three early civilisations of the Near East and South Asia, and of the three, the most widespread. Its sites spanned an area from northeast Afghanistan, through Pakistan's Sindh and Punjab
    provinces, to western and northwestern India.[3][b] The civilisation flourished both in the alluvial plain of Indus River, which flows through the length of Pakistan, and along a system of perennial monsoon-fed rivers that once coursed in the
    vicinity of the Ghaggar-Hakra, a seasonal river in northwest India and eastern Pakistan.[2][4]</p>
